# Monthly Problem Sets

Following the [Stellenbosch Camp](../stellenbosch), students are sent a set of assignments to complete each month. At the very least, there is an assignment for January and for February that are used together with the results from the Stellenbosch Camp to select students to attend another training camp at the end of March or the beginning of April.
