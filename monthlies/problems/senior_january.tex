Jacob has a balance scale and wishes to buy weights from Sipho. Sipho tells Jacob that he sells weights in the following way: Jacob has to specify a sequence of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dotsc a_n$, and then Sipho will make 1 weight of mass $a_1$, two weights of mass $a_2$, etc., and $n$ weights of mass $a_n$.

What is the maximum $k$ for which Jacob can specify some sequence $(a_1, \dotsc, a_n)$ and still be able to measure every integral weight from $1$ to $k$? (For example, with weights with mass $4$ and $7$, he can measure a weight of $3$ by putting one weight on the one side and the other on the other side of the balance scale.)

Does there exist a natural number $n$ such that
\[
	1^{2018} + 2^{2018} + \cdots + n^{2018}
\]
is prime?

\item % Modified version of IMO1999 Problem 2
Fix a natural number $n \geq 2$. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that
\[
	 \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} x_i x_j (3x_i^2 + x_j^2)(x_i^2 + 3x_j^2) \leq C {\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i \right)}^6
\]
for all non-negative real numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$. For this value of $C$, when does equality occur?
