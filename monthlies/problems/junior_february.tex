The (English language version of the) game of Scrabble\texttrademark consists of 100 tiles, each containing either a letter from A to Z (some letters occur more than once), except for two blank tiles; see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble_letter_distributions#English}{\texttt{the relevant Wikipedia page}} for the exact distribution of multiplicities of each letter.

In a solo game of Scrabble, the player starts by choosing seven tiles from the 100 available tiles at random. What is the probability that the player does not pick up any vowels?
