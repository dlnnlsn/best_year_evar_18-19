Call a function $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ \emph{almost linear} if $f(m + n) - f(m) - f(n)$ only takes finitely many values as $m$ and $n$ vary through the natural numbers. Suppose that $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and $g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ are almost linear. Show that $f(g(n)) - g(f(n))$ only takes finitely many values as $n$ varies through the natural numbers.
