\item %Estonia 2000/2001 National Round Grade 9 Q1
Sophie had to solve a math problem in the class. While cleaning the blackboard, she accidentally erased a part of her problem as well: the text that remained on board was $37\cdot(72+3x)=14{**}45$, where $*$ marks an erased digit. Show that Sophie can still solve her problem, knowing that $x$ is an integer.


\item %Romania 2017 District Round Grade 7 Q3
On the side $CD$ of square $ABCD$ point $E$ is chosen such that $\angle ABE = 60^{\circ}$. Point $F$ is chosen on line $AB$ such that $BE = BF$ and point $A$ is between $F$ and $B$. Let $M$ be the intersection of lines $EF$ and $AD$.
\begin{itemize}
\item [a)] Find $\angle BME$.
\item [b)] The bisector of angle $CBE$ intersects $CD$ at $N$. Find the angles of triangle $BMN$.
\end{itemize}


\item % Estonia National Olympiad 2005/2006 Grade 9
Let there be $n \geq 2$ real numbers such that none of them is greater than the arithmetic mean (normal average) of the other numbers. Prove that all the numbers are equal.


\item %Romania 2017 Final Round Grade 6 Q2
Consider the isosceles triangle $ABC$ with $\angle A = 100^{\circ}$. Let $BD$ be the angle bisector of $\angle ABC$ with $D$ a point on $AC$. Let $E$ be a point on $BD$ such that $BE=BC$ and where $D$ is between points $B$ and $E$. Let $F$ be a point on $BC$ with $F$ between $B$ and $C$ such that $AB=BF$. Prove that the lines $AC$ and $EF$ are perpendicular.


\item %Russia 2014 Grade 9 Q3
The teacher gave Emma four distinct integers and asked Emma to calculate the greatest common divisor of every two of these numbers. She got the answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and $N$ where $N>5$. What is the smallest possible value of $N$?


\item %Estonia 2000/2001 National Round Grade 9 Q5
A table consisting of $9$ rows and $2001$ columns is filled with integers $1,\,2,\,\ldots,\,2001$ in such a way that each of these integers occurs in the table exactly $9$ times and the integers in any column differ by no more than $3$. Find the maximum possible value of the minimal column sum (sum of the numbers in one column).


%\item % IPMO 2006 Junior Individual Q5
%If $a = 2^{2006} + 2^{-2006}$ and $b = 2^{2006} - 2^{-2006}$ then what is the value of $a^2 - b^2$?


%\item % IPMO 2008 Junior Individual Q11
%Paul likes dogs. At present all his adult dogs are Dalmatians while some of his puppies are Dalmatians and some are not. In all he has 11 dogs of which 7 are Dalmatians and 8 are puppies. How many Dalmatian puppies has he?


%\item % IPMO 2006 Junior Team Q6
%How many distinct factors does 1 000 000 000 have?


%\item % IPMO 2008 Junior Team Q9
%If a regular octagon has side length 1 cm, find the distance between the opposite sides.


\item % SW-2013-3
Let $n$ be a positive integer. Both $n$ and $n^2$ only contain the digits $1$, $2$ and $3$ (not necessarily all of them). Determine all possible values of $n$.


%\item % DB-2012-2
%Given a (not necessarily convex) quadrilateral $ABCD$, call a point $P$ in the same plane as $ABCD$ an \emph{areal centre} for $ABCD$, if any line through $P$ divides $ABCD$ into two parts of equal area. What are necessary and sufficient conditions on $ABCD$ for it to possess an areal centre?


\item % The Liam
The (English language version of the) game of Scrabble\texttrademark{} consists of 100 tiles, each containing either a letter from A to Z (some letters occur more than once), except for two blank tiles; see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble_letter_distributions#English}{\texttt{the relevant Wikipedia page}} for the exact distribution of multiplicities of each letter.

In a solo game of Scrabble, the player starts by choosing seven tiles from the 100 available tiles at random. What is the probability that the player picks up exactly two vowels?
