\item % IPMO 2006 Junior Team Q4
\[ \sqrt[3]{\frac{2+1}{2}\cdot\frac{3+1}{3}\cdot\frac{4+1}{4}\dotsm\frac{a+1}{a}} = 4. \]
Find the value of $a$.

\item % IPMO 2005 Junior Team Q3
A circle of radius $1$ is centred at the origin. Two particles start moving at the same time from the point $(1,0)$ and move around the circle in opposite directions. One of the particles moves counterclockwise with constant speed $\nu$ and the other moves clockwise with constant speed $3\nu$. After leaving $(1,0)$, the two particles meet first at point $P$, and continue until they meet next at point $Q$. Determine the coordinates of the point $Q$.

\item % IPMO 2005 Junior Team Q6
Determine the number of triplets $(k,l,m)$ of positive integers such that
\begin{align*}
  k+l+m &= 97 \quad \mathrm{and} \\
  \frac{4k}{5} +\frac{5l}{6} +\frac{6m}{7} &= 82.
\end{align*}

\item % DB-2012-1
A positive integer is called \emph{special} if its digits can be arranged to form an integer divisible by $4$. How many of the integers from $1$ to $2018$ are special?
