SENIOR:

A/C/G: Three sticks, red, white and blue, are each 1 meter long. Julie breaks the first stick into three parrts; then Ben does the same with the second stick; and then Julie breaks the last stick into three parts. Can Julie break sticks so that, no matter what Ben does, it would be possible to assemble from the nine parts, three triangles such that each trianglehas sides of different colours? \source{Leningrad 1991, Grade 6}

(also Int) N/C: The number of pearls found by divers is less than 1000. They shared the pearls in the following way: In turn, each diver took from a pile exactly one half or one third of the pearls remaning in the pile. After each diver had taken his share, the remaining pearls were sacrificed to the Sea God. What is the greatest number of diviers that could take part in the pearl sharing? \source{Leningrad 1991, Grade 7}

N: The decimal representation of the number $N$ contains no zeroes. Let $M$ be the number obtained by reversing the digits of $N$, and let $p$ the product of the digits of $N$. Find all $N$ satisfying $NM = 1000+p$. \source{Leningrad 1991, Grade 8}

(also Int?) A/G: The sides of a triangle have integer side lengths a,b,c. Prove tat if the length of one altitude of the triangle is equal to the sum of the other two, then $a^2+b^2+c^2$ is the square of an integer. \source{Leningrad 1991, Grade 9}

(also Int?) C/N: Start with an integer $a_1$. In step one, take any digit of $a_1$ and subtract it from $a_1$ to form $a_2$.

Prove that for any natural number, we can perform a sequence of such operations and turn it into a one-digit number. \source{Leningrad 1991, Grade 11} (Seems hard)

G/C: a square of side 2 is tiled with (2 or more) rectangles. Prove that one can shade some of these rectangles so that the projection of the shaded region onto one side of the square would have length no smaller than 1 and the projection of the shaded region onto another region would have a length no greater than 1. \source{Leningrad 1990, Grade 7}
