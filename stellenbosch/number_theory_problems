Determine the smallest integer, such that the product of its (decimal) digits is 216.

Consider the number $111112222200000$ consisting of five ones, five twos and five zeros. Is it possible to rearrange the digits to form a perfect square? (You may move a zero to the front. That has the effect of reducing the total number of digits.)

Write down the sequence obtained by writing all the digits of odd integers in sequence: 1357911131517192123\ldots Find the 2018-th digit in this sequence.

What number is directly above the number 222 in the array:
\[ \begin{array}{ccccccc}
&&&1\\
&&2&3&4\\
&5&6&7&8&9\\
10&11&12&\cdots
\end{array} \]

Show that for any positive integer $n$, the number $3^n+7^n$ ends on a 0.

Find the last digit of $2^{1+2+\cdots+ 2018}$ (last two digits?)

If the numbers $a,b,c$ are all prime numbers, solve the equation
\begin{align*}
	a+b &= 108\\
	a-b-c &= 32.
\end{align*}

Solve the equation
\[ 4a+5b+15c = 75\]
in prime numbers. 

Given any two-digit number $n$, let $S(n)$ be the sum of the digits of $99n$. Show that you always get the same answer, no matter which two-digit number $n$ is chosen.

Prove that for any integer $n$, one has
\[ \frac{1}{1+2} + \frac{1}{1+2+3} + \frac{1}{1+2+3+4} + \codts +  \frac{1}{1+2+\cdots+n} = 1 - \frac{2}{n+1}.\]

A polygon has six times as many diagonals as it has sides. How many sides does it have?

Find the two largest primes whose squares divide $95!+96!+97!$.

How many scalene triangles with integer side lengths are there, whose largest side has length 19?

$N$ is a six-digit number whose sum of its digits is 37, and the sum of the digits of $N+1$ is 2. Find $N$.
