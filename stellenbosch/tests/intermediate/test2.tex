\item %The Aether
The magical country of Vertexia, there are a certain number of cities. Each pair of cities is connected by a magical portal, and it turns out that there are 5050 portals in total. How many cities are there in this wonderful land?

\item 
Let $M$ be the midpoint of side $AB$ of equilateral triangle $ABC$, and let points $N$, $S$ and $K$ divide side $BC$ into four equal segments. Given that $P$ is the midpoint of $CM$, prove that $\angle MNB = \angle KPN = 90^\circ$.

\item % Problem 2.17 (Russia 1972)
Show that if we are given 50 segments on the real line, then either there are 8 of them which are pairwise disjoint or 8 of them with a common point. 

A segment is defined as a closed interval $[a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \;:\; a \leq x \leq b \}$.
