\item % Estonia 2007
An exam with $k$ questions is presented to $n$ students. A student fails the exam if they get less than half the answers right. We say that a question is easy if more than half of the students get it right. Decide if it is possible that

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]  All students fail even though all the questions were easy.
    \item[(b)] No student fails even though no question was easy.
\end{enumerate}
