\item[1.]  Prove that it is impossible to write a positive integer in every cell of an infinite chessboard, in such a manner that, for all positive integers $m, n$, the sum of numbers in every $m\times n$ rectangle is divisible by $m + n$.

\item[2.] An exam with $k$ questions is presented to $n$ students. A student fails the exam if they get less than half the answers right. We say that a question is easy if more than half of the students get it right. Decide if it is possible that

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]  All students fail even though all the questions were easy.
    \item[(b)] No student fails even though no question was easy.
\end{enumerate}

% Asiatic Pacific Maths Olympiad, 1989, Q3
Let $A_1, A_2, A_3$ be three points in the plane, and for convenience, let $A_4 = A_1$, $A_5 = A_2$. For $n = 1, 2$ and $3$, suppose that $B_n$ is the midpoint of $A_n A_{n+1}$ and suppose that $C_n$ is the midpoint of $A_n B_n$. Suppose that $A_n C_{n+1}$ and $B_n A_{n+2}$ meet at $D_n$ and that $A_n B_{n+1}$ and $C_n A_{n+2}$ meet at $E_n$. Calculate the ratio of the area of triangle $\triangle D_1 D_2 D_3$ to the area of triangle $\triangle E_1 E_2 E_3$.

\item[4.]  Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $abc = 1$. Prove that
\begin{equation*}
    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 3 \geq 2(ab + bc + ca)
\end{equation*}

\item[5.]   Let $p_1 = 2$ and define a sequence of prime numbers $p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots$ such that, for all positive integers $n$, $p_{n+1}$ is the least prime factor of $n \cdot p_1^{1!} \cdot p_2^{2!} \dots p_n^{n!} + 1$. Prove that all primes appear in the sequence.
