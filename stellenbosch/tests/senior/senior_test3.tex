\item[3.]
Consider an 8x8 grid of squares. On each square is a lightbulb initially off. A move consists of choosing a square and either the verticle or horizonal direction, and toggling the lightbuld on that square and it's immediate neighbours, in the chosen direction. For clarity this means that usually 3 bulbs are flipped unless the square is on an edge in which case 2 bulbs may be flipped. After some amount of moves a single bulb is switched on (the other 63 are off). Determine which of the 64 bulbs can possibly be on.
