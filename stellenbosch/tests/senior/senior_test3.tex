\item[1.] Consider all the triangles $ABC$ which have a fixed base $AB$ and whose altitude from $C$ is a constant $h$. For which of these triangles is the product of its altitudes a maximum?

Show that for all positive real numbers $x$ and $y$, \[ \frac{x^2}{x+2y} +\frac{y^2}{2x+y} \geq \frac{x+y}{3}. \]

\item[3.]
Consider an 8x8 grid of squares. On each square is a lightbulb which is initially switched off. A move consists of choosing a square and either the verticle or horizonal direction, and toggling the lightbulb on that square and it's immediate neighbours in the chosen direction. For clarity this means that usually 3 bulbs are flipped unless the square is on an edge in which case 2 bulbs may be flipped. After some amount of moves a single bulb is switched on (the other 63 are off). Determine which of the 64 bulbs can possibly be on.
