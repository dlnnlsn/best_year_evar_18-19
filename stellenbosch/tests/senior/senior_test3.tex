\item[1.] Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and let the midpoint of $AC$ be $M$. The circle tangent to $BC$ at $B$ and passing through $M$ meets the line $AB$ again at $P$. Prove that $AB \times BP = 2 BM^2$.

Show that for all positive real numbers $x$ and $y$, \[ \frac{x^2}{x+2y} +\frac{y^2}{2x+y} \geq \frac{x+y}{3}. \]

\item[3.]
Consider an 8x8 grid of squares. On each square is a lightbulb which is initially switched off. A move consists of choosing a square and either the verticle or horizonal direction, and toggling the lightbulb on that square and it's immediate neighbours in the chosen direction. For clarity this means that usually 3 bulbs are flipped unless the square is on an edge in which case 2 bulbs may be flipped. After some amount of moves a single bulb is switched on (the other 63 are off). Determine which of the 64 bulbs can possibly be on.
