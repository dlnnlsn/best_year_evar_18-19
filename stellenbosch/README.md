# Stellenbosch Camp 2018

A camp is held in December each year. Traditionally, this camp has taken place at the University of Stellenbosch. Students are invited to attend the camp primarily based on their results in the South African Mathematics Olympiad. This camp is the first in a series of camps that makes up the selection and training programme for South Africa's participants in the Pan-African and International Mathematics Olympiads.

Students are divided into three streams: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Intermediate and Advanced students write a test lasting 2.5 hours each morning. The Beginner students also write tests, but only on the first and on the last day. The test on the last day lasts 4 hours instead of 2.5 hours. It has more problems than the other tests, and is also intended to be more difficult.

After the test each morning, and in the afternoons, students attend a series of lectures. These are on topics that are grouped broadly into the traditional olympiad categories of Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, and Combinatorics. Students have free time in the evenings.

For convenience, links to compiled versions of each test and each set of solutions are included below.
