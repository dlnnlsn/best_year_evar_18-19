# South African Mathematics Training Programme: 2019-2020

This repository contains the materials used for the 2019-2020 South African Mathematics Training Programme, the primary objective of which is the training and selection of students for the Pan-African and International Mathematics Olympiads.

Students are invited to a training camp in December each year. Selection for this camp is based on a student's performance in various mathematical competitions and activities throughout the year, the most important of which is the fianl round of the South African Mathematics Olympiad. Traditionally, this camp has taken place at the University of Stellenbosch, and so has come to be known as the "Stellenbosch Camp" or "Stellies Camp". (Or simply "Stellies")

At the Stellenbosch Camp, students are divided into three stream: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. The Advanced group writes a test each morning that lasts 2.5 hours. The tests and solutions for the 2019 Stellenbosch Camp are available in the [`stellenbosch`](./stellenbosch) folder.

Following the Stellenbosch Camp, students are given an assignment to commplete each month. These are known as the "Monthly Assignments", or simply "Monthlies". Usually there are at least three sets of assignnments: one each for January, February, and March, but assignments are often sent out later in the year as well. The monthly problem sets from 2020, together with solutions, are available in the [`monthlies`](./monthlies) folder.

The results from the Stellenbosch Camp, and the first two or three assignments are used to select students to attend another training camp in March or April. (Traditionally this has taken place in April, and the camp is known as the "April Camp", even when it takes place in March.) The tests and solutions from the April Camp are available in the [`april`](./april) folder.

The results from the April Camp, together with the results from the monthly assignments and Stellenbosch Camp (with the April Camp results carrying more weight) are used to select a team of 6 students for the Pan-African Mathemtics Olympiad, and another team of 6 students for the International Mathematics Olympiad.

A final training camp for each team is held just before the competition itself. The details of these camps have varied considerably over the years, and occasionally are a joint training camp with another country participating in the IMO.
